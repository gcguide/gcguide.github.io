# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I field more than 3 outfielders?

>  I understand the GameChanger app is used mostly for Majors and Minors divisions and not for non-competitive divisions like Machine Pitch. In Machine Pitch, we usually have 4 or 5 outfielders so all of the kids can be fielding and no one is benched. Is there any way the app allows for more than 3 outfielders? If so, how?

In the settings of GC you can add a fourth outfielder. You won't be able to add five. [Here are directions on how to do so.](https://gamechanger.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/213569643-Adding-Extra-Fielders-and-Batters-)

Having a maxiumum of four outfielders shouldn't be too big of a deal at that level, though, as the GC tracking will be more for batting than fielding.
